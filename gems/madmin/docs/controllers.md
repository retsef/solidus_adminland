# Customizing Controllers

When you generate a resource, it will generate a matching controller that you can override as needed.

For example `rails g madmin:resource Post` generates `app/controllers/madmin/posts_controller.rb`.

Refer to the resources_controller to what is accessible and how the normal actions look: [resource_controller.rb](../app/controllers/madmin/resource_controller.rb)
