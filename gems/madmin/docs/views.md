# Configuring Views
The views packaged within the gem are a great starting point, but inevitably people will need to be able to customize those views.

You can use the included generator to create the appropriate view files, which can then be customized.

For example, running the following will copy over all of the views into your application that will be used for every resource:

```bash
rails generate madmin:views
```
