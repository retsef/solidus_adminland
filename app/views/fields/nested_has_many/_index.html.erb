# HasMany Index Partial
This partial renders a has_many relationship,
to be displayed on a resource's index page.
By default, the relationship is rendered
as a count of how many objects are associated through the relationship.
## Local variables:
- `field`:
  An instance of [Administrate::Field::HasMany][1].
  A wrapper around the has_many relationship pulled from the database.
