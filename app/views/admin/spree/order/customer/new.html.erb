# New

This view is the template for the "new resource" page.
It displays a header, and then renders the `_form` partial
to do the heavy lifting.

## Local variables:

- `page`:
  An instance of [Administrate::Page::Form][1].
  Contains helper methods to help display a form,
  and knows which attributes should be displayed in the resource's form.
